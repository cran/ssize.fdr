Description: This package contains a set of functions that calculates 
 appropriate sample sizes for one-sample t-tests, two-sample t-tests, 
 and F-tests for microarray experiments based on desired power while 
 controlling for false discovery rates. For all tests, the standard
 deviations (variances) among genes can be assumed fixed or random. 
 This is also true for effect sizes among genes in one-sample and two
 sample experiments. Functions also output a chart of power versus sample
 size, a table of power at different sample sizes, and a table of critical
 test values at different sample sizes.
